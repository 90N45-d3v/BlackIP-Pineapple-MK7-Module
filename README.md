# WiFi Pineapple MK7 Module: DenyIP

### The Official Repository for the DenyIP Pineapple Module
This module gives you the possibility to quickly add IPv4 or IPv6 addresses to a deny list and refuse/drop their traffic. Public IP addresses on that list won't be able to send data to LAN. Local IP addresses on that list won't be able to send data to WAN

*As soon as my pull request is accepted, this module will be available in [Hak5's official module repository](https://github.com/hak5/pineapple-modules) and should be available for download directly from the web interface of the WiFi Pineapple.*

### Compile it yourself...
1. Run `./build.sh` in the DenyIP directory
2. Upload the `dist/DenyIP` directory onto your WiFi Pineapple at `/pineapple/modules/`

### Or use the pre-compiled folder at [releases](https://github.com/90N45-d3v/DenyIP-Pineapple-MK7-Module/releases)
1. Unzip the [latest version](https://github.com/90N45-d3v/DenyIP-Pineapple-MK7-Module/releases/latest)
2. Upload the directory onto your WiFi Pineapple at `/pineapple/modules/`
